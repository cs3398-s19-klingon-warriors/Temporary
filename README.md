# Out of the Woods

Welcome! We are the Klingons, a group of undergraduate Computer Science students at Texas State University, using this project as a way to learn software engineering principles, get experience with Agile development and sprints, and hopefully build the start of something useful.
We are creating a personal safety web application to alleviate stress and mitigate harm as a result of precarious or unpredictable situations. The application sends a notification to an emergency contact if the user: doesn’t arrive at their designated destination, thinks they are in danger, or just wants a friend to know their location. Our goal is for users to achieve independence without sacrificing their own safety. 
Out of the Woods is gender inclusive and focuses on people traveling, local or abroad, hikers, and families.

This idea was inspired by the increasingly growing cultural norm to meet new people from the internet. From dating applications, such as Tinder or Bumble, to friendships blossoming from message boards, such as Reddit, it is no longer as stigmatized to say you’ve met someone from the internet. However, just because there’s no embarrassment from it, doesn’t necessarily mean it’s without its faults and 100% safe. That’s where Out of the Woods comes into play.
